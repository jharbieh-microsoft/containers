# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving these docs. A few guidelines:

- Open an issue to discuss larger changes before sending a pull request.
- Keep PRs small and focused; one change per PR makes review easier.
- Use clear commit messages and include a short description in the PR body.
- For docs changes, prefer simple Markdown and include links where relevant.

Maintainers may update or reformat contributions as needed.
