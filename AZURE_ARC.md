Azure Arc is Microsoft’s hybrid and multi-cloud management platform that extends Azure services, governance, and security to on-premises, edge, and other cloud environments. It enables organizations to unify management of resources across distributed infrastructures while retaining cloud-native capabilities.

## Core concepts

- Azure Arc provides a single management plane in Azure to manage resources that live outside Azure (servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases, and more).
- Arc-enabled servers and clusters use lightweight agents to register and connect resources to the Azure control plane; connected and disconnected deployment models are supported for edge or isolated networks.
- For Kubernetes, Arc enables "Arc-enabled Kubernetes" which lets you apply Azure management, policy, and services to external clusters while preserving native Kubernetes operations.

## Key features

- Centralized resource management: inventory, tagging, and unified policy enforcement across on‑premises, multi‑cloud, and edge resources via Azure Portal and Azure Policy.
- Azure services on-premises: deploy selected Azure-managed services (for example, Azure SQL or Azure Data Services) to run close to the data for residency or latency requirements.
- Security & identity: integrate with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Azure RBAC, and Azure Security capabilities for centralized access control and compliance reporting.
- Observability: integrate with Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights to collect metrics, logs, and alerts from Arc-managed resources.
- Automation & governance: use Azure Policy, Update Management, and automation runbooks to detect configuration drift and orchestrate updates consistently.

## Operational benefits

- Simplified governance: consistent policy and compliance checks across heterogeneous environments.
- Flexibility: supports hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios where workloads must remain on-premises or at the edge.
- Service parity: for supported services, run cloud-managed services locally to meet data residency and latency constraints.

## Common use cases

- Hybrid fleet management: manage Windows and Linux servers across datacenters and clouds from Azure.
- Kubernetes governance: apply policies and deploy configurations to remote Kubernetes clusters with centralized control.
- Edge and disconnected scenarios: operate critical workloads in edge locations with periodic connectivity to Azure.
- Data residency and compliance: host data-sensitive services locally while benefiting from managed service features.

## Limitations & considerations

- Agent footprint: Arc requires an agent or connector on each managed resource; plan for deployment and lifecycle management overhead.
- Feature availability: some Azure services on Arc have limitations compared to their cloud-native equivalents; check service-specific docs before deployment.
- Network and connectivity: disconnected or high-latency networks may limit features that rely on continuous connectivity to Azure.

## Summary

Azure Arc bridges the gap between cloud and distributed infrastructure by bringing Azure management, security, and selected services to resources wherever they run. It is particularly useful for enterprises with hybrid, edge, or regulatory requirements that need centralized governance and consistent operations across heterogeneous environments.
