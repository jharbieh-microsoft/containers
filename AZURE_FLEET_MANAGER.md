Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Fleet Manager) is a management platform focused on multi-cluster operations for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It provides a centralized control plane to orchestrate, monitor, and maintain multiple Kubernetes clusters across regions and environments from a single interface.

## Core concepts

- Fleets and membership: Fleet Manager lets you group AKS clusters into fleets (logical groupings) to simplify policy enforcement, application deployment, and lifecycle operations across many clusters.
- Hub cluster model: Fleets can include a managed hub cluster (hosted by AKS) that runs control components for workload placement, update orchestration, and multi-cluster networking. The hub is managed by Azure to ensure stability.
- Policy propagation: Fleet-level policies and configurations can be propagated selectively to member clusters or specific namespaces, enabling consistent governance and configuration drift prevention.

## Key features

- Multi-cluster orchestration: Deploy and manage applications, network policies, and configurations across many clusters from a centralized plane.
- Automated updates: Define update profiles, maintenance windows, and staged rollouts to orchestrate OS and Kubernetes upgrades across fleets with approval gates.
- Monitoring & observability: Integrates with Azure Managed Grafana, Prometheus add-ons, and Azure Monitor to aggregate metrics and logs across fleets.
- Security & compliance: Centralized RBAC, policy enforcement, and identity controls to ensure enterprise standards across member clusters.

## Operational benefits

- Scale management: Reduce operational overhead when managing large numbers of AKS clusters by centralizing common tasks and policies.
- Consistency: Enforce uniform configurations and policies to reduce drift and simplify compliance.
- Predictable maintenance: Staged update strategies and maintenance windows minimize disruption during upgrades.

## Common use cases

- Multi-regional AKS deployments for global applications.
- Consistent application propagation across development, staging, and production clusters.
- Centralized monitoring and troubleshooting for distributed Kubernetes environments.
- Simplified lifecycle and compliance management for enterprise Kubernetes fleets.

## Limitations & considerations

- AKS-only (today): Fleet Manager primarily manages AKS clusters; non-AKS cluster support is limited or planned for future releases.
- Managed hub cluster: The hub cluster is controlled by Microsoft-managed processes; direct user modification is restricted to protect stability.
- Networking and integration gaps: Some advanced east-west networking or Arc-enabled Kubernetes integrations may be limited; validate specific scenarios.

## Summary

Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager provides a focused, centralized solution for multi-cluster AKS operations. It complements tools like Azure Arc by concentrating on Kubernetes orchestration, update management, and fleet-wide governance to simplify large-scale Kubernetes operations.
